I'm Nick, a web developer from Nottingham, UK. This is what I'm doing [now](http://nownownow.com/about).

* Taking a course on Node.js
* Going swimming
* Playing the guitar (a Fender Jaguar)

This site was made by writing a custom theme for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using Sass and HTML, without frameworks. I'm planning on compiling the theme into a ruby gem at some stage, but it is constantly a work in progress...
